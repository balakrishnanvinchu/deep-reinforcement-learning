        "The Actor-Critic agent was trained on ICU sepsis treatment data to learn optimal intervention policies. The reward function was designed to encourage stabilization of vital signs (mean BP, SpO2, respiratory rate) towards clinically normal ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "During training, we observed that the agent initially produced highly negative rewards as it explored the action space randomly. Over time, the rewards became less negative as the agent learned to select actions that improved patient vitals. The episode lengths remained relatively stable, indicating consistent exploration across the ICU stays.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reward trends showed gradual improvement, though with some variability due to the stochastic nature of the environment and the exploration strategy. The critic network helped reduce variance in policy updates by providing more stable value estimates compared to pure policy gradient methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The policy stabilized after about 50 episodes, with diminishing returns in reward improvement thereafter. This suggests the agent had converged to a reasonable policy given the environment constraints. However, further training with different hyperparameters or network architectures might yield better performance.\n",
